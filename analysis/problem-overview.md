# Problem Overview

This project analyzes maternal and demographic factors related to newborn birth weight using the `birthwt` dataset from the MASS package in R. The focus is on identifying patterns that may be associated with low birth weight through exploratory data analysis.

## Objectives
• Understand dataset structure and variable types  
• Explore demographic characteristics of mothers  
• Transform indicator variables into meaningful factor labels  
• Summarize groups such as birth weight category, smoking status, and physician visits  
• Visualize distributions, including age and maternal weight  
• Analyze relationships between birth weight category and other variables using tables and plots  

## Focus
To identify meaningful patterns related to low birth weight and apply foundational exploratory analysis techniques in RStudio.
