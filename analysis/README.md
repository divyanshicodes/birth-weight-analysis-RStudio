# Birth Weight Analysis in RStudio

This project explores maternal and newborn health factors using the `birthwt` dataset from the MASS package in R. The analysis focuses on identifying potential risk indicators for low birth weight through structured exploratory data analysis.

### 🔍 Key Analysis Components
• Loading and inspecting the dataset  
• Checking dimensions and structure  
• Converting numeric indicators into meaningful factor variables  
• Renaming factor levels for better readability  
• Summary statistics for demographic variables  
• Histograms, scatterplots, and boxplots  
• Understanding relationships between variables  

### 🧰 Tools & Environment
• RStudio  
• R  
• MASS package  

### 🎯 Goal
To identify and visualize key maternal factors associated with low birth weight using exploratory data analysis techniques in RStudio.
